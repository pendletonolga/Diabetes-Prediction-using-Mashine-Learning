# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Mashine-Learning
The project objective was to create a machine learning model to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements.
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
The project revealed that characteristics such as age, blood pressure, glucose, BMI and insulin were among the most significant indicators for predicting diabetes thereby enabling more targeted prevention and intervention strategies.
